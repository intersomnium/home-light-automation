# Light automation for an apartment.
The script is made to be implemented on a RaspberryPi that controls the lighting system in a household. There should be two IR sensors on every door, so that the direction of movement can be deduced. It enables automatic switching and/or dimming of lights based on room occupancy and frequency of use.

This version is created using pygame and is for logic demonstration purposes only.
